# Next-slice queue (orchestrator reads top-down)

**This is the orchestrator's per-cycle starting point after a compact.** Read the TOP unblocked
item → dispatch ONE self-sufficient cycle-runner subagent for it → read its <10-line report →
move on. The cycle-runner owns all bookkeeping (commit specific files, push, verify CI, close the
issue, append its loop-log row, QA). See `docs/runbook/LOOP.md` → **Lean orchestrator protocol
(post-compact)**. Re-prioritise only when a higher item lands or the owner files new feedback.

**PREEMPTION RULE:** an owner `from-owner` **P1** issue (filed via the PM Desk — including the
**async Telegram intake**, `studio/comms/OWNER-CHANNEL.md`) **jumps to the top** of this queue,
ahead of everything below. Owner P1s preempt; do them first, then resume here.

**OWNER-DECISION RULE:** items marked **[OWNER-DECISION]** are *questions to ask the owner*, not work
to do. Surface them over the **two-way owner channel** (Telegram) with options — `owner-channel.sh
ask …` for a tappable choice — log them under `OWNER-CHANNEL.md` → ## Pending questions, and route
his reply back (never auto-adopt).

**QUEUE-SYNC RULE (Retro 9):** after any PM-desk intake batch, **re-sort this queue's top before the
next build dispatch** — a flat "items to file" list in `loop-state.md` is not a prioritised queue.

**PHASE-LABEL RULE (Retro 10, extended Retro 11):** several umbrellas (#94/#97/#101/#106/#70) shipped
a phase and stay OPEN. "OPEN" ≠ "untouched" — each line states **what shipped vs. what remains** so
priority tracks *delivered* value, not the issue's open/closed flag. **Retro 11 addition:** an
umbrella that **hosts a standing rule** (e.g. **#70** = the "1–2 sea-delight beats per loop" rule)
stays OPEN *deliberately* and is marked **[STANDING-RULE]** — it is **not** a candidate to close even
when its latest slice shipped.

---

_Set by **Retro 12** (2026-06-28, loops 62–68). State: the **reactive loop is CLOSED end-to-end** —
walk into a tavern → listen → chase a rumour with a **map marker** → arrive to a **reward** (coin +
Ballad verse) → Set Sail and the watch **reads your visit back** (#112/#111/#115 + #105). **Both
reputation poles now have symmetric verbs:** the pirate half (raid/false-colours/legend) is mirrored
by the governor half — **claim & grow a home port** for Standing (#118). **The open sea is now
reactive** — a foundering ship offers a rescue-vs-plunder moral choice (#125). **Each port sounds
like itself** (#69) and **recalls your last deed by name** (#104b). And the **save system is
hardened** — a declarative migration codec + frozen old-save corpus (#122) after we caught a REAL
silent-wipe bug (see below). **669 tests**, perf **32/130 draws · 90k/150k tris**, save **v12**.
Latest `v0.0.20260628070429`._

_**⚠️ #122 process headline (now a standing rule):** `deserialize` had hard-rejected any save whose
version ≠ current → **every schema bump (v8→v12 over ~20 cycles) silently WIPED player progress**,
undetected because tests only ever round-tripped a *current* save. Fixed structurally. **Standing
rule:** a save-schema change is not done until it migrates every prior version forward AND a frozen
blob of the new version is added to the corpus (the coverage guard enforces it)._

_**Next leverage: make the symmetric poles FELT, finish the engine de-risk that protects battle, and
lock down the closed loop.** Battle-mode **#100 remains [OWNER-DECISION], owner-held** — it has waited
the WHOLE session with the owner absent. Keep it HELD; do **NOT** auto-promote — but it is worth a
**gentle owner nudge** (it is both the biggest content gap and a long-stale decision)._

## Top of queue (do in order) — poles are symmetric + loop closed → make it FELT + harden before battle

**PM/TL: the rumour-payoff loop, ashore digest, per-town music, port-memory depth, at-sea encounter,
the governor home-port verb, and the save-migration codec ALL SHIPPED & CLOSED (loops 62–68).** The
next build top makes the now-symmetric poles *visible* (#126), then finishes the engine de-risk that
must precede battle (#120), then locks down the closed loop (#123). **#100 battle remains the owner's
to steer** — HELD, not auto-promoted; nudge gently.

1. **#123 — QA golden-replay fixture for the full reactive loop** (seed→listen→sail→reward) — only
   became meaningful now that the loop closes end-to-end; protects the crown jewel. Pairs with #121's
   gate invariants, which ride **with** battle #100. _value **medium** · complexity **low-med** · qa._
   **Now top.**

2. **#130 — Migrate the remaining hand-wired systems onto the registry** (#120 follow-up) — incremental,
   behaviour-preserving each step; the registry mechanism + a representative block shipped Loop 70.
   _value **med** · complexity **medium** · tech. Natural home for #36 fixed-timestep + the seam battle
   #100 plugs into._

- ~~**#126 — Reputation-reactive world grade**~~ — ✅ **SHIPPED & CLOSED** (Loop 69, v0.0.20260628073440).
  Diegetic rhumb-line heading wisp for #111 remains a separate art/design follow-up.
- ~~**#120 — Self-registering systems registry → thin `main.js`**~~ — ✅ **MECHANISM SHIPPED, #120 STAYS
  OPEN** (Loop 70, v0.0.20260628074440). `src/systems/registry.js` + a representative block migrated
  byte-for-byte; remaining systems → **#130** (above).

## [OWNER-DECISION / HELD — owner-held all session; gentle nudge due] — ask, don't auto-promote

- **#100 — arcade battle-modes** (combat/loadouts/boarding). **HELD for the Game-Designer owner brief
  — has now waited the ENTIRE session with the owner absent.** Its mode-switch infra (#95) + seam
  (#106 ph1) + QA (#107) + the save-migration codec that protects it (#122) are all built; battle is
  the one empty room. **Keep HELD; do NOT auto-promote** above where the owner wants it — but it is
  both the biggest content gap and a long-stale decision, so **send a gentle owner nudge** over the
  channel (with options, never auto-adopt). When it lands it likely jumps the top; the de-risk quartet
  (#120/#121/#123) should ride WITH it.

## DL #4 candidates (research reservoir — below the top trio + the #100 hold)

_Filed by **Deep-Learning #4** (9-role fan-out). See `studio/retros/2026-06-28-deep-learning-4.md`.
Asset-light, original-work-only, reactive-verbs-first. Ordered by leverage._

- **Engine/gate de-risk — ride WITH battle #100 (Retro 11/12: a QA-coverage slice on each state-space
  growth; #122 generalised it to the player's *data*):**
  - ~~**#115 — typed world-target model (`objectives.js`)**~~ — ✅ **SHIPPED & CLOSED** (Loop 62, folded
    into #112/#111). One source of truth for marker/arrival/payoff/digest.
  - **#120 — self-registering systems registry → thin `main.js`** — _promoted to TOP (#2 above)._
  - **#121 — gate resource-conservation invariant** (mesh leak across an N×N cycle) **+ transition-frame
    perf sample**. _tech+qa P2; ride WITH #100; oracle for #106 slice-4._
  - **#123 — QA golden-replay fixture for the full reactive loop** — _promoted to TOP (#3 above)._
  - ~~**#122 — declarative save-migration codec + frozen old-save corpus**~~ — ✅ **SHIPPED & CLOSED**
    (Loop 68). Caught + fixed the silent save-wipe; corpus now gates every future bump.
- **Governor pole — make the unbuilt half of the north-star reachable (Product):**
  - ~~**#118 — governor's first reactive verb: claim & grow a home port**~~ — ✅ **SHIPPED & CLOSED**
    (Loop 67, save v12). Both poles now have symmetric verbs.
  - **#119 — governorship endgame milestone** (title mirroring the pirate legend-crown #46). _design P3;
    deps #118 (done) + named isles #19. PARK until after #126 + battle._
- **Loop feedback / charm (pull around the top three):**
  - **#116 — diegetic feedback for the reactive loop** (listen/reach/payoff music stingers + interaction
    SFX + a warmer remembered-port arrival cue). _audio P3; rides the now-closed loop; procedural-only._
  - **#117 — seeded per-pass melody variation** (kill sail-loop fatigue; per-pass *time* variation,
    orthogonal to #69 per-port). _audio P3._
- **Reactive-world reservoir:**
  - **#124 — crew morale/loyalty meter** fed by your choices (DL #1's never-built earned-mutiny; also the
    battle surrender/boarding currency). _design P3; the next reactive meter after the poles._
  - ~~**#125 — emergent at-sea encounter: a foundering ship, rescue vs plunder**~~ — ✅ **SHIPPED &
    CLOSED** (Loop 66). Follow-ups: more encounter types, richer outcomes (grateful crew that fights
    alongside), a flying distress flag.

## Rumour-loop depth (#112 umbrella OPEN — close more reward kinds)

- **#127 — Trade rumour live price-spike** at the named port (richer chase payoff vs a flat bounty).
  _feature/design; deepens the closed loop._
- **#128 — Disposition/bounty rumour spawns a matching vessel** (chase a prize/patrol — a 2nd rumour
  type that proves the typed-objective pattern generalises). _feature/design._

## Charm / atmosphere fillers (from-owner; slot in around the depth slices)

4. **#106 — Mode-seam hardening, slice 1** (declarative `{[mode]:{onEnter,onLeave}}` registry — sugar
   over the bus). Cheap; **now overlaps #120's systems registry — sequence them together.** _(slice 4
   per-mode disposal PARKED — blocked on #100 battle meshes.)_
5. **#110 — Living fauna phase 2: jumping dolphins** (#97 continues; gulls shipped). P2 from-owner.
6. **#101 — props phase 3: loose props** (lanterns/market stalls **feed the town mode** #96/#103).
   P2 from-owner. _(island dressing shipped via #71; texture-embed + extra variety PARKED.)_
7. **#129 — Per-town music, richer** (distinct melodies/instrument sets + a dedicated docked cue +
   live tempo — the #69 full follow-up). P3 audio.
8. **#70 [STANDING-RULE] — ocean sail-over curios** (flotsam/turtle/bottle → SFX + witty-line pool —
   the issue's *original* slice 1) + **#113** bow-spray flourish + **#114** sea-colour variation /
   current streaks. **#70 stays OPEN deliberately** as the home of the "1–2 sea-delight beats per
   loop" rule — do NOT close it. P2 from-owner.
9. **#68 — seagulls: louder calls near the coast** (SFX exists) + tie to the #97 visual flock. P2 from-owner.

## #94 remaining phases (P1 OPEN — but phase-1 headline acceptance is MET; not top-of-queue)

10. **#94 — rotating sea themes** (phase 2) + **real battle cue** (phase 4, rides #100) + **real audio
    files behind `loadTrack`** (phase 5 — **PARKED on an asset/owner decision**). #69 (phase 3, per-town)
    is promoted to the top trio above. _Proximity crossfade + mode-aware bed already shipped (Loop 50)._
11. **#109 — mode-aware audio craft** (constant-power crossfade · bar-clock transitions · procedural
    per-mode reverb · modal recolour). P3 audio. _Rides #94._
12. **#108 — per-mode perf budget + throttle world work in town** (gate ocean/wake + DPR by mode).
    P2 tech. _Promote **#36 fixed-timestep** above #84 (DL #3)._

## Depth / DL reservoir (between-mode fillers; prefer depth over breadth)

13. **#72 — cannon-combat depth follow-ups** (hull-damage visuals, tougher foes/gunnery spread, more
    aims, fleeing chase, cannon audio, foe initiative). Much of it **feeds #100 battle** — revisit
    after the owner brief.
14. **#80 — combat/harbour game-feel "juice" pass** (hit-stop, screenshake, camera punch; toggle-able).
    Pairs with #102's landfall punch + any #100 battle.
15. **#90 — Ballad richer composition** (more deed types · share-as-image) — deepens the #78 lever. P3.
16. **#92 — richer privateering** (faction/bounty + persisted Letter-of-Marque commission + more false
    ensigns) — **its bounty side feeds #112 rumour-payoff**. DL reservoir: **#82 crew chorus**,
    **#81 hull creak**, **#83 watercolour chart**, **#40/#35 Klezmer 'freygish' + procedural cannon
    SFX** (pairs with the #94 battle cue).

## Polish (cheap, charming, compounds shareability — natural fillers)

17. **#15 — comedic loading-tip line pool.** — _humour surface, near-zero cost._
18. **#21 — HUD coins placeholder + cleaner layout.** — _legibility; sets up future HUD work._
19. **#88 — full weather (rain/storm/clouds), optional behind the #73 toggle.** — _extends day-night._

## Enablers / tech debt (schedule, don't let them perpetually lose)

20. **#36 — fixed-timestep accumulator loop.** — _**DL #3 promotes this above #84**: "the world lives
    under a paused helm" wants a sim that steps independently of input/render; `playerPaused` is its
    natural seam. Unlocks #108 + record/replay golden traces (extends #107)._
21. **#38 — lightweight PR-validation CI gate** (tests + headless playtest, no deploy). — _Retro 8's
    allow-list means script/test-only pushes no longer run unit tests at all; this is the proper home._
22. **#37 — tolerance-based deterministic visual diff.** Open since cycle 10. — _automates the last
    manual visual-QA step._
23. **#74 — PWA service worker (offline caching).** · **#75 — mobile safe-area/landscape/low-end
    polish.** · **#84/#85 — WebGPU / OffscreenCanvas spikes** (DL #2 tech reservoir; #84 below #36).

## Blocked / held
- **#99 — sail zones** (invisible regions driving music; later hostility/weather) — P3, naturally
  rides #94 + the #95 mode/zone seam; revisit after the rumour loop + battle land.

## ⏳ iOS — batch the next owner re-test (Retro 10, still open)
- Three device-dependent slices are shipped **best-effort, UNCONFIRMED** pending one owner iPhone
  re-test: **#77** audio unlock · **#87** no-text-select · **#93** ship's-wheel touch. Don't stack
  dependent work; ask the owner to confirm all three on the latest build in one pass.
