# Feedback REGISTER — the PM desk pipeline

Index of every owner-feedback item and its current status. The PM desk keeps this in lockstep
with the item files in `inbox/`. Raw items are never deleted — only their status advances.

**Pipeline:** `raw → triaging → needs-clarification → assessed → accepted (#issue) / parked / declined`

| Status | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| `raw` | Captured, untouched. The owner's "don't act yet" guarantee. |
| `triaging` | PM is interviewing the owner. |
| `needs-clarification` | Waiting on the owner to answer a question. |
| `assessed` | Has a PM `value` note + a TL `feasibility` note. |
| `accepted` | Owner confirmed → GitHub issue created + on the roadmap. |
| `parked` | Worth revisiting later; reason logged. |
| `declined` | Not pursuing; reason logged. |
