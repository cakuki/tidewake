# Loop runbook — changelog (index)

Terse history of how `LOOP.md` (and the studio process) evolved. **Full detail lives in the retro
files** `studio/retros/<date>-retro-N.md` and `studio/comms/decisions.md` — this is just the index so
`LOOP.md` itself stays lean.

- **2026-07-02 — #88 Weather: the sky comes alive — clouds gather, a squall greys the sea, the
  light dims (Loop 137, v0.0.PENDING; extends the #58 day-night system, behind its own #73-panel
  toggle, DEFAULT OFF; #88 stays OPEN for heavier storm/wind follow-ups).** Ships the weather half of
  #88 as the smallest high-charm increment: a seeded, deterministic weather cycle (clear → clouds →
  squall → clearing) that composes ON TOP of day-night. Toggle ON and sail long enough and a front
  comes on the wind — a distant cloud bank gathers on the horizon, a rain squall greys the sea and dims
  the light, an occasional distant flash cracks over the swell — then it clears. PURE, TDD'd-first
  `weather(phase)` + `applyWeather(base,w)` in `src/weather.js` (no three.js — THREE injected so it
  stays node-testable; `darken=0` is a byte-for-byte no-op so clear === today's sky); a thin
  `createWeather(refs)` factory composes on day-night's live palette each frame and owns the CHEAP
  visuals — one instanced cloud ceiling (1 draw) + one GPU-shader rain particle system (1 draw,
  `uTime`-animated, zero per-frame alloc). Wired at systems order 115 (after daynight 110, before
  reputation-grade 120 — reputation eases from the weathered base, composes not compounds); new
  `weather` toggle in the #73 panel (default OFF); QA surface `tw.weather` + `tw.setWeatherPhase`.
  1369 unit tests (+9 new) + playtest green (new §2j-w gate: OFF = clear + ZERO weather draws / true
  no-op, deterministic state progression, a squall greys+dims and draws 2, composes with day-night,
  OFF restores byte-for-byte). Perf 29/130 draws · 92,780/150k tris with weather OFF (the default);
  weather ON at squall adds only +2 draws; leak-invariant +0 (visuals built once, visibility-toggled).
  **NO save change — stays v18.** Day-night (#58) / reputation-grade (#126) / battle stack / mobile
  (#146) / mode-aware music all untouched. Gallery `studio/qa/gallery/weather-squall-88.png`.
  **Remains (#88 OPEN):** heavier storm FX (bigger squall swell, forked lightning + thunder SFX,
  wind-streaked rain) and GAMEPLAY weather (wind on the sails, reduced visibility) — the storm/wind follow-up.
- **2026-07-02 — #129 Each harbour greets you with its own docked flourish (Loop 136,
  v0.0.20260702081147; the #69 per-town-music follow-up; #129 stays OPEN for the deeper follow-ups).**
  Deepen the shipped #69 per-town identity (a re-voiced drone) into a felt AUDIBLE beat: making landfall
  now rings a dedicated **DOCKED CUE** voiced in the town's own key/mode, with a per-town motif **shape**
  (rise/peal/call/lilt) and its **timbre** (leadType) — so arriving at a port sounds like arriving
  *somewhere with character*, distinct from the approach swell and from every other harbour. PURE
  `townDockedCue()` + `TOWN_CUE_SHAPES` in `src/town-theme.js` (deterministic, junk-safe — the town chord
  an octave up, ordered by a seed-picked motif); `src/music.js` `voiceStinger` voices the current town's
  cue and `stinger()` latches the docked port's cue at landfall (no percussive bed, no `loadTrack`);
  still bar-quantised (fires on the next downbeat), `setTownTheme` glide unchanged. TDD'd first (town-theme
  + music unit tests: determinism, distinctness, in-key, arm-on-landfall); playtest asserts distinct ports
  → distinct cues and that landfall arms the docked port's own flourish, AudioContext-free. 1360 unit tests
  + playtest green; perf 29/130 draws · 92,780/150k tris (audio = +0 draws). **NO save change — stays v18.**
  Battle (#158) / mode-aware bed (#94/#109) / harmonic mood (#132) / #69 identity all untouched.
  **Remains (#129 OPEN):** distinct per-town melodies for the *drone/bed* itself, fuller instrument sets
  beyond leadType (accordion vs fiddle vs fife), live tempo per town (needs a re-timing scheduler).
- **2026-07-02 — #70 A drifting spar — the sea carries the wreckage of your wins (Loop 135,
  v0.0.20260702075438; post-RISE polish lane slice 4/4 — the lane is now COMPLETE; #70 stays OPEN
  [STANDING-RULE]).** A third open-sea curio in the shipped bottle/turtle idiom (`src/curios.js` +
  `src/curio-math.js`): a snapped ship's beam wallowing **awash** — RISE-flavoured, the sea now carrying
  the debris of the fights you've been winning, a wry (touch-dark) nod that the world notes a rising
  legend. Deterministic seeded spawn, distance-culled, ONE reused low-poly tapered-beam mesh (**≤1 extra
  draw**), its own soft **timber-groan SFX** (`audio.sfxSpar`), and an original **11-line anti-repeat
  witty-line pool**. Purely additive; ambient open-sea only (never a fight); no mechanics. Pure logic
  TDD'd (`curio-math.test.mjs` + a focused new-kind case); `qaProbe` extended to prove every kind's cue +
  anti-repeat (`perKind`), playtest asserts the spar spawns, draws ≤1, culls off-stage, fires its cue, and
  never repeats a line — no regression to bottle/turtle. 1350 unit tests + playtest green; perf 29/130
  draws · 92,780/150k tris. Gallery `drifting-spar-70.png`. **NO save change — stays v18.** The post-RISE
  polish lane (#175 · #90 · #80 · #70) is COMPLETE → the next cycle runs PRODUCT to refill the roadmap.
- **2026-07-02 — #80 Climax juice — a notorious kill slow-mos, a surrender hushes the camera (Loop 134,
  v0.0.20260702074006; post-RISE polish lane slice 3/4; #80 stays OPEN for the deferred harbour-settle beat).**
  Built #80's two deferred climax events on the SAME `src/systems/juice.js` rig (the shake stack + the
  real-time hit-stop drain), NOT a new system: `bountyKill()` — sinking a wanted **bounty vessel** (#173)
  lands the full (capped) hit-stop THEN a **bounded beat of slow-mo** (time-dilation) before the world
  snaps back, so a notorious kill FEELS like a moment (an ordinary kill still `sink()`s); and
  `cameraSettle()` — "she strikes her colours" (#135/#172) eases the camera to a HUSH (a smooth sin-breath,
  never a shake, camera-only). Safety: the slow-mo drains on REAL wall-clock time inside `consumeHitStop`
  (the only place it falls), bounded to [min,1] and never 0, so it always auto-resumes and can never stall
  the loop or desync the sim clock; the deterministic `tw.step()` path never calls it, so the fixed sim /
  #121 mesh-conservation gate stays pristine. Both beats fully suppressed by the "Combat feel" toggle +
  `prefers-reduced-motion`. Pure curves TDD'd (`timeScale`, `settleEnvelope`); 1349 unit tests + playtest
  (real bounty-kill → slow-mo, real surrender → settle, decay-to-zero, no-stall, toggle-off) green; 0 extra
  draws (camera/time only). **NO save-schema change — stays v18.** Remains: the harbour docking ease/settle.
- **2026-07-02 — #90 The Ballad sings your RISE — rank/hull/guns as deeds (Loop 133,
  v0.0.20260702071856; post-RISE polish lane slice 2/4; #90 stays OPEN as the Ballad umbrella).**
  THE RISE created rich progression the end-of-voyage Ballad couldn't yet narrate. Added three
  live-recorded deed types to `src/voyage-log.js` so the voyage reads its own climb back as a story,
  not just numbers: **rank** climbed (#169, pole-shaded "rose to Corsair"), **ship** bought (#171,
  named as a trade "the sloop for a frigate"), **gun** fitted (#170, singing the new broadside total).
  Each fires from the LIVE RISE event (rank-up crossing / shipwright / gunsmith purchase) into the
  existing deed stream, woven into the composition + the #149 share-card for free; **bounty** (#173)
  and **harbour-grow** (#174) were already wired and singing. Deeds fail open in `sanitizeLog`, so NO
  persisted-field / schema change — **save stays v18**. Pure logic TDD'd (record / dedupe-per-milestone
  / pole-lean / compose; +10 unit tests, 1340 total); playtest §2b7b-ballad drives the live hooks and
  asserts each RISE event contributes its verse (rank→"Reaver", gun→"5 guns", ship→"sloop→brig") and the
  surrounding composition (opening · superlative · closing tally · footer) still holds; text-only, 0
  draws. **Remains (#90 open):** the seeded "daily voyage" tie-in, PNG share via the mobile Web Share
  API, further mood/length variation, and deed types that would need a new tracked field / #122 migration
  (best profitable trade, coin milestones as their own verse, ports charted). #80 climax-juice next.
- **2026-07-02 — #175 Dread's HEAR half shipped — a fearful hail NAMES you when the sea blinks
  (Loop 132, v0.0.20260702070249; post-RISE polish lane slice 1/4).** #172 shipped dread's SEE + FEEL
  (a weak, outclassed ship flees on sight / strikes her colours early to a feared, bigger captain) but
  left the HEAR half silent. Now when a dreaded foe reacts, the world NAMES you: a short fearful hail
  sized to your notoriety ("God ha' mercy — it's the Corsair!" / "Colours DOWN — no soul crosses Dread
  Captain and swims!"), drawn anti-repeat from a small original pool and spoken on the EXISTING hail
  banner + the tier-aware reputation-sting audio bus — your Infamy is now something you HEAR, not just a
  number. PURE TDD'd picker `src/systems/fearful-hail.js` (fearTier off the same notoriety ramp #172
  flees against; pole-aware pools — pirate feared / governor deferential; {title} substituted;
  anti-repeat). Wiring reuses #172 end-to-end (no new mechanic/UI/combat path): npc.js flags a DREAD
  flee distinct from the #79 colours-flee; main.js fires the cry ONCE on the rising edge (flee) / folds
  it into the surrender banner (early strike); withheld under a false-colours disguise for free; a
  peer/apex (~0 dread pressure) stays SILENT. Playtest asserts flee→named cry (text matches title/tier),
  anti-repeat across two bolts, apex→silent, early-strike→named, peer's vanilla strike→silent. Text +
  audio = 0 draws (perf 29/130 · 92.8k tris). **NO save change (presentation only, stays v18).** Next
  in the polish lane: **#90** (the Ballad sings your RISE).
- **2026-07-02 — #174 Governor-pole symmetry shipped — invest spoils to grow your home port VISIBLY;
  EPIC #168 "THE RISE" COMPLETE + CLOSED (Loop 131, v0.0.20260702062846).** The RISE FINALE (slice 6/6) —
  the governor road's mirror of buying a bigger ship: pour your takings into your home port and SEE it PROSPER
  (new warehouses on the shore, more boats at anchor, more masts crowding the quay), in tiers driven off the
  already-persisted `harbour.level`. PURE tier→dressing model in `src/systems/port-growth.js` (TDD'd, 11 cases;
  MAX_TIER mirrors home-port MAX_LEVEL) → the visible tier DERIVES from state already persisted, **NO save
  change (stays v18)**. Three.js reveal in `src/port-growth-view.js` (deck-guns pattern): ONE InstancedMesh per
  kind, revealed by tier + distance-culled wholesale (#121) — at most three instanced draws, only near home.
  Playtest asserts invest→tier-up, port-view-reflects-tier, gated-by-spend, capped, reload re-grows DERIVED from
  persisted state. Perf 29/130 draws · 92780 tris; leak +0. Gallery `port-growth-174.png` (claimed berth vs
  jewel of the lanes). **Epic #168 is now COMPLETE across 6 slices** — the reward→progression→mastery loop is
  closed: rank-up (#169) → buy-cannon (#170) → buy-ship (#171) → world-fears-you (#172) → bounty-board (#173) →
  port-growth (#174). Both poles now have a visible power fantasy (pirate: a bigger ship · governor: a
  prospering port). The loop next runs PRODUCT to refill the roadmap (lane drained).
- **2026-07-02 — #173 The bounty board shipped — a named target + tier-scaled purse; the earn→spend loop
  CLOSED (Loop 130, v0.0.20260702055950).** Epic **#168 "The Rise"** slice 5/6 — the "one more voyage"
  hook. A port board posts a NAMED wanted vessel (`the Grey Gull`…) with a tier-scaled purse (#167-symmetric:
  tier-4 warship frigate = 400c + fame). Accept → she rides the EXISTING `state.objective` slot as a NEW KIND
  (`bounty`, a new target kind `ship` — NOT a new system) so the chart marker pins her hunt for free; run her
  down + defeat her (sink/capture) → the board pays the purse ONCE into coin (+ fame in renown), which funds
  the Workshop/Shipwright (#170/#171). PURE TDD'd model in `src/objectives.js` (`makeBounty`/`bountyReward`/
  `resolvesOnDefeat`/`bountyPayoff`/`pickBounty`; disjoint name pools so a random foe can't claim); board UI in
  `ui/town.js`; a `bountyFoe` dressing hook in `battle.js` (the ship at the marker IS the target); claim in
  `main.js` `onResolve`; Ballad verse in `voyage-log.js`. **Rides the existing objective persistence — NO save
  change (stays v18).** Gate: `npm test` + playtest PASSED (accept→marker, defeat-target→claim-once into coin,
  wrong-target→no-claim, claim-once), perf 29/130 draws · 92.8k/150k tris. Gallery `bounty-board-173.png`.
  **#174** (governor-pole symmetry) is the LAST slice of the #168 lane.
- **2026-07-02 — #172 The world fears you shipped — weak ships flee / strike early to a feared captain
  (Loop 129, v0.0.20260702052934).** Epic **#168 "The Rise"** slice 4/6 — the world reacts to your rise.
  Now that a captain can grow notorious (#169 ranks) and BIG (#171 class), the world NOTICES: a
  much-outclassed, much-feared captain makes WEAK prey blink — a merchant sloop **flees on sight** before
  you engage, and a broken foe **strikes her colours EARLIER**. Scaled by the GAP (notoriety + hull class
  vs hers): a peer holds and the apex warship man-o'-war never breaks to dread (**protects #167** — real
  fights still exist); dread is withheld under a false-colours disguise (#79 intact). New PURE core
  `src/systems/dread.js` (notoriety ramp + class advantage + foe firmness → dread pressure → flee threshold
  + early-strike morale lift), TDD'd (15 cases). Reuses the EXISTING flee steering (npc.js) + strike-colours
  path (`board.offersSurrender`) — no new combat system. **NO save change (derived; stays v18).** SEE the
  sea part as your notorious sails crest · FEEL your reputation has weight. Gallery
  `world-fears-you-172.png` (a green sloop captain vs a feared frigate Corsair — she runs). #172 closed;
  epic #168 stays open (slices 5–6 remain; #173 the bounty board next).
- **2026-07-02 — #171 Buy a bigger ship shipped — the hull VISIBLY grows (Loop 128,
  v0.0.20260702043931).** Epic **#168 "The Rise"** slice 3/6 — the biggest power fantasy. At the town ⚓
  Shipwright you now **spend coin to step UP a ship class** (sloop → brig → frigate; the warship man-o'-war
  deferred), giving the PLAYER the class system that until now was NPC-only (#163). All three payoffs land:
  **SEE** the hull grow to dwarf the sloop you started in (the mesh scales by the REUSED `ship-classes.js`
  `sizeScale` — ~1.74× at frigate, multiplied onto the base normalising scale; no new geometry, #121),
  **HEAR** a triumphant launch sting, **FEEL** the class combat stats apply to YOU — a heavier broadside
  (offence flows through #170's `getBroadsideMult` seam, composing with owned cannons) and a tougher hull (a
  new default-1 `playerArmor` divisor on `cannons.resolveBroadside`/`resolveExchange`, byte-identical legacy).
  PURE core `src/systems/ship-class-upgrade.js` (ladder + escalating cost 600/1400c + pure buy math + the
  class→player-stat map; the sloop is the exact pre-#171 ×1.0 baseline so a fresh voyage is byte-identical),
  TDD'd. Shipwright plank in the town workshop (`src/ui/town.js` + `index.html` CSS). **NO save bump** —
  persists in the v18 `shipClass` field #170 already RESERVED (default sloop); just wired (persist on buy,
  apply on load). Playtest asserts buy→coin-deducted + class-up + hull-scales + heavier-bite + soaks-more +
  **survives a v18 reload** + combat reflects. Gallery `buy-a-bigger-ship-171.png` (a frigate dwarfing a
  sloop at identical framing). #171 CLOSED; epic #168 stays OPEN (#172 the world fears you next — no bump).
  Art follow-up #144 (a CC0 ship-class set) noted, not a blocker — the class scale is a real visible change now.
- **2026-07-02 — #170 Buy a cannon at the Gunner's Workshop shipped — SEE it on your deck (Loop 127,
  v0.0.20260702041455).** Epic **#168 "The Rise"** slice 2/6 — the owner's canonical broken-arrow fix. At
  the town ⚒ Gunner's Workshop you now **spend coin for a PERSISTENT extra cannon** (small cap +3), landing
  all three payoffs: **SEE** a new bronze gun bolted to your deck the instant you buy it, **HEAR** a boom as
  she's run out, **FEEL** foes fold sooner (owned cannons feed a `broadsideMult` into
  `cannons.resolveBroadside`/`resolveExchange` — base ×1 → full ×1.48). PURE core
  `src/systems/gun-upgrade.js` (cost curve 180/340/560c · clamp · buy math · damage map · deck slots), TDD'd;
  deck mesh `src/deck-guns.js` reuses ONE shared barrel/carriage geometry, hidden guns aren't drawn (#121).
  **SAVE v17→v18 — the lane's ONE bump:** persists `extraCannons` **AND reserves #171's `shipClass`** (default
  sloop) so the lane bumps once; migrates every prior version forward + a frozen v18 corpus blob + coverage
  guard green (#122). Playtest asserts buy→coin-deducted + owned+1 + deck-gun-shown + heavier-bite + capped +
  **survives a reload (v18 round-trip)**. Gallery `buy-a-cannon-170.png`. #170 CLOSED; epic #168 stays OPEN
  (#171 buy-a-bigger-ship next, rides this v18 — no further bump).
- **2026-07-02 — #169 Rank-up milestone shipped — the felt "you rose" beat (Loop 126,
  v0.0.20260702033359).** Epic **#168 "The Rise"** slice 1/6. Crossing into a new `renown.js` rung now
  ANNOUNCES itself: a title card naming the new rank with pole-appropriate tone — dread on the pirate road
  ("You are now feared as a **Corsair**"), respect on the governor road ("The council names you
  **Magistrate**") — plus a triumphant sting (`playDuelHit('win')`), so the rise finally has a heartbeat
  instead of two silent numbers. New PURE core `src/systems/rank-milestone.js` (pole-aware copy +
  forward-crossing detector + a **"highest rung seen"** once-only guard) reads the EXISTING ladder — invents
  no new economy. **SAVE-FREE (stays v17):** the guard is a TRANSIENT in-session baseline seeded from the
  already-persisted rep on load, so a captain who loads in at a high rank never re-announces, and a rung
  dropped after a defeat (#164) then re-climbed never re-fires. The fragile inline detection was lifted out
  of `hud.renderLedger`; `main.js` drives it as a system after onboarding so the richer named card wins the
  shared toast on the first crossing, and defers to the legend crown (#46) at the very top rung of a
  committed pole. SEE the title · HEAR the sting · FEEL the climb; DOM card + audio = **0 draws**. 19 new
  pure unit tests; playtest asserts crossing→fires-once, non-crossing→silent, drop-then-re-climb→no re-fire;
  perf 29/130 draws. Gallery `studio/qa/gallery/rankup-milestone-169.png`. #169 CLOSED; epic #168 stays OPEN
  (#170 the cannon-buy is next — the lane's only save bump).
- **2026-07-02 — #70 slice 1 Ocean sail-over curios shipped — a sea-delight beat (Loop 125,
  v0.0.20260702025543).** The empty sea now rewards attention: while under way a small curio drifts in
  ahead of the bow — a corked **BOTTLE** bobbing in the swell or a sea **TURTLE** breaking the surface —
  and sailing over it plays a soft synthesised cue AND raises a **wry line** from an original pool that
  **never repeats twice in a row**. Pure delight between the fights: no mechanics, **no save change (v17)**.
  Matches the #110 dolphin idiom: PURE model TDD'd first (`src/curio-math.js` — seeded deterministic spawn
  schedule, spawn-ahead-of-bow, a `sailedOver` distance trigger with no raycasting, distance cull, and the
  charm-guarantee `pickLine` anti-repeat picker); the factory (`src/curios.js`) reuses **one mesh per kind**
  (geometry allocated once, never per spawn → honours the #121 mesh-conservation gate), keeps **one curio
  live at a time**, hidden wholesale between appearances / off-stage / **in battle** (ambient open-sea only)
  → **≤1 extra draw**. Soft cues `audio.playCurio` + a HUD line. New playtest §2o'' asserts a curio spawns +
  draws while sailing, deterministic spawn, ≤1 draw, culled to 0 off-stage, the cue fires, and the witty
  line never repeats back-to-back. 1238 unit tests (9 new) + playtest; perf 29/130 draws · 92.8k/150k tris;
  leak-invariant geom +0. Gallery `v0.0.20260702025543-sea-curio.png`. **#70 stays OPEN [STANDING-RULE]** —
  home of the "1–2 sea-delight beats per loop" rule; deferred: more curio variety, tap-picking, #113
  bow-spray, #114 sea-colour.
- **2026-07-02 — #80 Combat game-feel "juice" pass shipped — make a hit LAND (Loop 124,
  v0.0.20260702023718).** The fights are visible (#161 cannonballs) but floaty; this makes impact FELT.
  **Generalises** the existing #155 broadside camera kick — the SAME shake stack + 0-draw `cameraOffset()`,
  explicitly NOT a second camera effect — so a clean bite on HER and her reply raking YOU both now ROCK
  the view scaled by the hull bite, adds a bounded **HIT-STOP** (a few-frame sim freeze on a solid strike)
  and a **SINK** punctuation (a graze ≠ a full broadside ≠ a kill). Hit-stop is safe by construction: it
  zeroes the sim `dt` for the real frames it lasts in `loop()` only and drains on real wall-clock time, so
  it is bounded (~5 frames), auto-resumes, can never stall the loop or desync the world clock; the
  deterministic `tw.step()` path never freezes, so the fixed sim / #121 mesh-conservation gate stays
  pristine. Toggle-able ("Combat feel", default ON) + `prefers-reduced-motion` aware — off = fully
  playable, zero residual motion. Pure curves TDD'd (`src/systems/juice.js`); playtest §2b4c asserts the
  wiring end to end (event→shake/hit-stop, decay-to-zero, toggle-off suppression). No save change (v17).
  1229 unit tests + playtest + gallery `combat-juice-80.png`. **#80 stays OPEN** — deferred: boarding
  rail-clash shake, surrender beat, harbour docking ease/settle, kill time-dilation.
- **2026-07-02 — #159 Diegetic age-of-sail keycap skin shipped — deep-reading batch #153–#159 DRAINED
  (Loop 123, v0.0.20260702021440).** The #153 contextual key-prompts are re-dressed as the world speaking:
  **ink-on-parchment verb ribbons carrying rope-bound brass keycaps**, not a modern debug overlay — the
  SAME DOM component, a **pure CSS re-skin** (0 markup change, 0 draws). Labels stay 100% keymap-driven
  (`src/keymap.js`); a new render **drift-lock** (`tests/unit/key-prompts-render.test.mjs`) asserts the
  glyph+verb text rendered ON the brass keycap == the keymap, so a hard-coded skin label fails loudly.
  Contrast **survives the sea haze** — near-opaque cream parchment keeps dark ink legible over both bright
  water AND a dark hull; reactive tone kept diegetic (BOARD = verdigris sea-patinated brass, SURRENDER =
  deeper gilt edge); reduced-motion honoured; **no gameplay/save change (stays v17)**. Legibility and
  world-identity become one asset — the tutorial reads as the age of sail. Gallery `diegetic-keycaps-159.png`.
  Completes the R2 deep-reading shortlist (#153 prompts → #154 earcons → #155 juice → #156 FTUE gate →
  #157 first duel → #158 battle score → #159 skin).

- **2026-07-02 — #158 Per-phase battle musical signatures shipped (Loop 122, v0.0.20260702020352).**
  The raid's shipped three acts (⚔ Maneuver / 🪝 Boarding / 🗣 Duel — the #135 `raidPhaseModel`) are now
  **HEARD, not just seen**: each act wears a **distinct musical LAYER** (a different mode + register +
  drive, not merely louder) — ⚔ a driving mixolydian roll, 🪝 a dark freygish bite, 🗣 a sharp lydian a
  register up — cross-fading **equal-power on the bar-clock** (a pending swap held until the next
  downbeat), so **the score becomes the tutorial timer** (you hear the act change before you read it).
  New PURE, TDD'd **`src/systems/battle-score.js`** (`battleLayer` phase→layer map with all three acts
  sharing root/3rd/5th over the FIXED D-major bed, `crossfadeGains` constant-power, `nextTransition`
  bar-quantised planner; 14 unit tests). `music.js` is the thin shell (a battle layer-gain off
  `musicGain` with two parallel lead buses for a true act↔act crossfade committed on the downbeat) —
  **recolours the lead like #132/#109; NO percussive-bed trap, NO `loadTrack`**. Save stays v17; audio =
  0 draws. Deepens the shipped reactive-audio lane (#94/#109/#132) and reinforces the #135 legibility HUD.

- **2026-07-02 — #167 Challenge on demand shipped — epic #162 COMPLETE (Loop 121, v0.0.20260702014146).**
  The payoff of the whole difficulty/stakes/variety lane: a player who WANTS a hard fight can now SEEK one
  and get it. Danger is **FIXED BY REGION** (owner decision #162 — NO rubber-band): the safe home coast
  breeds gentle prey; the deep sea breeds frigates and — out past the points — the withheld **WARSHIP
  man-o'-war** (tier 5), now reachable if you sail out to meet her. A kill out there pays real fame:
  **spoils scale by foe TIER**, the symmetric mirror of #164's tier-scaled loss sting (high risk, high
  reward, both legible). The pure brain is new **`src/systems/danger.js`** (`regionDanger` maps a world
  position → the region's danger cap; `regionalSpec` picks a region-appropriate class×role — deep = the
  apex man-o'-war; DOM/THREE-free, unit-tested). `npc.js` now fixes each hull's class by its **spawn
  region** and guarantees one deep-water man-o'-war hunter that patrols the deep (so the coasts stay
  gentle); `spoils({…, tier})` in `cannons.js` adds a per-tier purse (`+15c/tier`, Infamy follows), with
  `tier` defaulting to 0 so every legacy caller/test is byte-identical. **No new meshes** (the man-o'-war
  reuses the #163 scaled mesh — perf 29/130 draws · ~93k/150k tris). Transient/positional — **NO save
  bump (stays v17)**. +9 danger unit tests + a spoils tier-scaling test (1200 total); a playtest
  §1b-challenge gate proves the FIXED rule out-classes the deep vs the coast, the warship man-o'-war roams
  the tier-5 deep (reachable), reward climbs monotonically with tier, no rubber-band, save v17. Gallery
  `challenge-on-demand-167.png`. **This CLOSES epic #162 — all 5 slices shipped: #163 ship classes →
  #164 loss stings → #165 threat labels → #166 legible odds → #167 challenge on demand.** FUN: point the
  bow at deadly water and FEEL the stakes rise (a bigger silhouette, redder skulls, a dire odds read) —
  a tier-5 terror worth real Infamy; mastery finally has somewhere to aim.

- **2026-07-02 — #166 Legible odds shipped — epic #162 "read whether you're favoured" (Loop 120, v0.0.20260702004439; salvaged after a 529).**
  The owner's fair-fight contract, made READABLE: "fair = clear, consistent rules WITH a bounded luck
  element — SKILL shifts the odds, LUCK swings the margin, and luck can't flip a strongly-favoured fight."
  A read-only odds/matchup readout now docks into the aim indicator's reserved `.aim-odds` slot during an
  engagement — a plain-language verdict ("You outclass her" / "An even match" / "She outguns you —
  reckless"), a legible damage-per-volley + bounded ±20% margin sub-line, and a visual **margin BAND** (a
  bar whose lit segment is the luck swing and whose side of the even-tick reads favoured-from-doomed;
  straddling centre = "the margin decides"). The pure brain is new **`src/systems/odds.js`** (`combatOdds`/
  `oddsReadout`, three.js-free, DOM-free, unit-tested): SKILL sets the deterministic edge from the class
  matchup (`ship-classes.js` hull+gunnery) + live aim geometry + the loaded shot; LUCK is only the shown
  ±20% band around it. The model MIRRORS `resolveBroadside`'s coefficients and is **cross-checked against
  the real combat math in tests** so the shown band == the actual luck bound and can never silently drift;
  a 'dominant' verdict is EXACTLY "even max-adverse luck still wins" (proven ≥99% over 2000 real sims), so
  luck can't flip a favoured fight. `setOdds()` in `aim-indicator.js` grew from a bare string to a
  structured `{text,sub,tier,bar}` (legacy string still works); `battle.snapshot()` gained `foeGunnery`+
  `foeTier`; an optional stake hint reads #164's `defeatLedger` so the odds also name what a loss costs.
  Coexists with the #161-s5 aim line, target lock, #165 threat labels, the #161-s2 non-occlusion safe-zone,
  and the #146 mobile guard. **No combat-math / luck-bound change; NO save bump — stays v17.** +21 unit
  tests (1191 total); a playtest §2b3-odds gate proves the matchup reads right, the band == ±20%, luck can't
  flip a strong verdict, and the read is docked + shown in the aim slot during a real fight (then clears on
  flee). Perf within budget (DOM readout +0 draws). Salvaged after the prior runner died on a 529 with the
  build uncommitted. #166 CLOSED; epic #162 kept OPEN (only #167 challenge-on-demand remains).
- **2026-07-02 — #165 Over-ship threat labels shipped — epic #162 "pick your fight" (Loop 119, v0.0.20260702001553).**
  The owner's #7 note for the difficulty/variety epic: "over-the-ship displays telling/hinting what ships
  are, so a player can CHOOSE fights and read danger at a glance." Every classed NPC hull now floats a
  class + threat label above her — **"Merchant Sloop ·"** (a green easy prize) up to **"Warship Man-o'-War
  ☠☠☠☠"** (a red deadly foe) — so you glance across the sea and instantly read who to hunt vs who to flee
  **before committing**. **One module, two consumers (the whole point of building it reusable):** reuses the
  SAME `src/ui/over-ship-billboard.js` from #161 slice 3 (the target ring) via its `setLabel()` slot — **no
  second billboard system**; the labels are **pooled** (one element per hull, created once + reused every
  frame → 0 DOM churn) and DOM/CSS → **0 draw calls** (perf within budget, DOM labels add +0 draws/tris).
  The pure brain is new **`src/systems/threat-label.js`** (three.js-free, DOM-free, unit-tested): `threatLabelFor`
  (class→text+glyph), `threatGlyphs` (skulls escalate strictly with tier so a man-o'-war reads deadlier than
  a sloop), `dangerLevel` (green prey→red deadly colour band), and the declutter rule `labelFade`/`selectLabels`/
  `maxLabelsForViewport` (fade with distance, cap the count, **a lower cap on a phone = the #146 guard** so
  labels never smother a small screen). In a fight the traffic's labels **recede** (eligibility) so the engaged
  foe's label + ring read clean together on the **same anchor**. **NO save-schema change** — pure presentation,
  stays **v17**. +16 unit tests (1171 total); a playtest gate asserts each live label's text+glyph match its
  class/tier, a man-o'-war reads STRICTLY deadlier than a merchant sloop, a far hull is culled, a phone caps
  labels 3<6, and the foe's ring+label coexist on one anchor while traffic recedes. Gallery `threat-labels-165.png`.
  #165 CLOSED; epic #162 kept OPEN (remaining: #166 legible odds, #167 challenge on demand).
- **2026-07-02 — #164 Loss stings shipped — epic #162 stakes layer (Loop 118, v0.0.20260701235745).**
  The owner's #1 note for the difficulty/stakes epic: "games are too easy — the player must be able to
  LOSE when playing badly, and a loss should COST points + fame." Two things now hold. (1) **You can
  actually lose:** `isDefeat({playerHull})` (a legible, tested, single-source rule in `src/systems/battle.js`
  — hull ≤ 0 under her fire → `finish('lose')`) is the clear player-defeat condition; skill sets the odds,
  the existing bounded ±20% luck sets the margin. (2) **Losing stings:** `defeatLedger(tier, context, ledger)`
  — the FIRST-ever reputation-DECREMENT path in `src/renown.js` (legend used to only ever grow) — deducts
  coin + fame on a loss: **MEDIUM** magnitude, **scaled by the foe's threat tier** (`ship-classes.js` via
  `foe.tier`), **CONTEXT-BASED** (`defeatContext` off the dominant pole → a raiding loss dents **Infamy**, a
  governor-road loss dents **Standing** — the pole you were pursuing), **coin dented too**, and **floored at 0**
  (never negative, no death-spiral — one loss never wipes a run). Surfaced by a red **"⚑ Colours Struck"**
  defeat card (`hud.showDefeat`) that **NAMES the cost** ("−N Infamy, −C coin"); it reuses the shared toast
  (already docked clear of the #161-slice-2 centre safe-zone) → **0 extra draws** (perf 29/130 · ~93k tris).
  Binding owner decisions (#162): MEDIUM · you KEEP your ship (fame/coin only) · context-based fame · **no save
  bump — deducts from already-persisted coin/infamy/standing, stays v17.** Fun beat: you SEE your fame + coin
  visibly DROP on the red card and FEEL that reckless fights now carry real risk (caution becomes a decision).
  +11 renown unit tests + 6 battle unit tests (tier scaling, context routing, floor, no-death-spiral, the
  defeat condition) + a playtest loss gate (a real defeat fires the ledger; raid→Infamy / governor→Standing;
  floored at 0; the card names the cost). Gallery `colours-struck-164.png`. **For #166/#167 to read:** the loss
  condition + the ledger (`isDefeat`/`defeatLedger`/`defeatContext` + `DEFEAT_*` constants) now exist — #166
  legible-odds can show the stake a loss carries, #167 challenge-on-demand scales its risk off the same tier→sting.
- **2026-07-01 — #163 Ship classes shipped — epic #162 FOUNDATION (Loop 117, v0.0.20260701233123).**
  The owner's steering: "games are too easy; ships should VARY; a player who wants a challenge can seek a
  big/armed ship." Establishes the ship-class model — sloop → brig → frigate → man-o'-war × merchant/warship
  — in a new PURE `src/ship-classes.js`: each (class × role) gets a hull (on the shared 0..100 combat scale),
  gunnery, gun count, crew, a visible `sizeScale` and a threat tier (1–5), plus `spawnMix` (a deterministic,
  always-varied fleet). The class feeds the EXISTING battle math with zero new mechanics: `makeFoe(rng, shipClass)`
  seeds the foe's hull+gunnery off the engaged hull's class (carried on the npc snapshot), so `battle.js`/`cannons.js`
  resolve a frigate as a genuine threat and a merchant sloop as easy prey; `npc.js` scales the reused mesh so a
  man-o'-war (1.6) visibly dwarfs a sloop (0.72) at **0 extra draws/tris**. Class selection runs off its own rng
  seed so spawn positions/movement stay byte-identical (the deterministic battle-camera playtest steps unchanged),
  and the warship man-o'-war (threat 5) is withheld from the open-sea pool — the opt-in #167 challenge — so an
  unlucky pass never yields an unwinnable fight. Fun beat: the sea stops being uniform — you SEE big warships vs
  little merchants at a glance and FEEL the difference the instant you fight one. +9 pure tests + a playtest
  ship-classes step (≥2 distinct classes with distinct hull/guns/size; a frigate's broadside out-bites a sloop's
  via `tw.qaClassCombat`). Gallery `ship-classes-163.png`. NO save-schema change — transient spawn props, stays v17.
  The foundation #164 (tier-scaled loss ledger), #165 (threat labels), #166 (odds) and #167 (challenge on demand) build on.
- **2026-07-01 — #161 slice 6 Hover-to-interact shipped — LANE COMPLETE, #161 CLOSED (Loop 116, v0.0.20260701224039).**
  The SIXTH and FINAL slice of the from-owner "Make Battle FUN" epic (#161): "interacting with other ships should
  be hovering on the ship in the view, not like a HUD element." Targeting was proximity + a keypress guess; now
  you POINT at a hull (a `THREE.Raycaster` picks the ship under the cursor) and it lights up with what you can DO —
  a projected cyan ring + a "Give battle / Hail / Board" label — and a CLICK routes to the SAME existing verb
  handlers (engage / hail / board), no new combat mechanics. Keyboard verbs stay live (additive); a touch TAP
  routes through the same click path (#146 guard). Respects the whole lane (s1 isolation — only the engaged foe is
  pickable mid-fight; s2 non-occlusion; s3 dimming). PURE, TDD'd cores in `src/systems/ship-picker.js`
  (`shipIndexFromObject`, `pickShipAction`, `actionLabel`, +11 tests); the raycast is a thin shell in `main.js`
  (reused Raycaster, refreshed hull matrices, 0 per-frame allocs). Generalized `battle.engage(index)` +
  `duel.tryChallenge({targetIndex})` so a click acts on THAT ship. Reuses the slice-3 over-ship billboard + VP
  projection — **0 added draws (still 29/130)**, 92.8k/150k tris. `tw.qaPickAt/qaHoverAt/qaClickAt` QA hooks;
  playtest §2b6-hover asserts a raycast under a screen point resolves to that ship + the right action AND a click
  routes to the handler (open-sea engage + battle board). Gallery `hover-interact-161.png`. No save change
  (input/presentation, stays v17). 1131 unit tests. **#161 "Make Battle FUN" is now COMPLETE — all 6 slices
  shipped (isolation · non-occluding UI · target lock · rendered cannonballs · aim-angle feedback ·
  hover-to-interact) and #161 is CLOSED.** Every owner complaint from the 2026-07-01 playtest is addressed.
- **2026-07-01 — #161 slice 5 Aim-angle feedback shipped (Loop 115, v0.0.20260701220930).** Fifth slice of the
  from-owner "Make Battle FUN" epic (#161): "the angles should matter." The angle already decided a clean-vs-wide
  shot in the maths (`broadsideAim`) but the player couldn't SEE their aim before firing. Fix + felt FUN beat: a
  read-only AIM LINE runs from your ship to the engaged foe and COLOURS + TIGHTENS as she comes abeam — green ON
  TARGET when the broadside will bite, amber closing, faint red wide when the guns can't bear — so lining up the
  broadside is a skill you can watch improving. PURE presentation off `broadsideAim` (via `battle.snapshot()`);
  the aim maths is UNTOUCHED. PURE, TDD'd cores in `src/ui/aim-indicator.js` (`aimReadout` on-target
  classification + firing-cone spread, `beamGeometry` bar layout, +10 tests); a DOM/CSS overlay reusing the
  slice-3 over-ship VP projection — **0 added draws (still 29/130)**. #166-COORDINATE-READY: the chip carries a
  reserved `.aim-odds`/`setOdds()` slot so #166 legible-odds docks beside it with no redo (this aim line is the
  *skill* half of that readout). `tw.aimIndicator()` QA hook; playtest §2b5-aim asserts an ABEAM foe reads ON
  TARGET (tight cone) vs a BOW-ON foe OFF (wide cone) and the line clears on flee — the explicit "can I see when
  I'm on target?" check. Gallery `aim-line-161.png`. No save change (transient UI, stays v17). 1120 unit tests.
  Slice 6 (hover-to-interact) remains — the LAST #161 slice (#161 OPEN).
- **2026-07-01 — #161 slice 4 Rendered cannonballs shipped (Loop 114, v0.0.20260701215515).** Fourth slice of
  the from-owner "Make Battle FUN" epic (#161): "we should see the cannon balls, the angles should matter." The
  broadside was pure MATH (a camera kick + the word "ABEAM") — nothing flew. Fix + felt FUN beat: a fired volley
  now SPAWNS a visible fistful of round-shot that arcs from the guns to the foe, a muzzle PUFF barks at the
  gunports, and each ball CRACKS into a spark on a clean beam HIT or SPLASHES pale in open water on a wide MISS —
  a good angle and a bad one read completely differently (the miss sails past into empty sea), driven off the
  SAME resolved shot (`broadsideAim.inArc` + `resolveBroadside.enemyHit`), combat maths untouched. POOLED +
  INSTANCED for perf: a PURE, TDD'd trajectory/hit-vs-miss controller (`src/systems/projectiles.js`, +14 tests)
  over a fixed pool that never allocates a mesh, rendered by exactly TWO reused InstancedMeshes created ONCE —
  **+2 draws (27→29/130), +~2.7k tris (~93k/150k), 0 geometry growth across mode cycles (#121)**. `tw.battleProjectiles()`
  QA hook; playtest §2b4b proves a broadside spawns iron + a muzzle bark and that a wide shot SPLASHES while a
  clean beam shot SPARKS (hit ≠ miss). Gallery `cannonballs-161.png`. No save change (transient VFX, stays v17).
  1110 unit tests. Slices 5–6 remain (#161 OPEN).
- **2026-07-01 — #161 slice 3 Target lock shipped (Loop 113, v0.0.20260701212549).** Third slice of the
  from-owner "Make Battle FUN" epic (#161): "while moving other ships are all around: I don't know which one
  I am fighting with!" The engaged foe (just `foeIndex`) was visually identical to the wandering traffic. Fix
  + felt FUN beat: the instant battle starts the foe carries an unmistakable world-anchored **target RING** (a
  projected DOM/CSS billboard above her mast — 0 draw calls) and the non-combatant traffic **RECEDES** to a
  faint opacity, so the foe reads instantly; it all clears the moment you flee. Built the **reusable OVER-SHIP
  BILLBOARD module** (`src/ui/over-ship-billboard.js`) — a generic marker/label anchored above a ship in world
  space, projected to screen; carries the highlight ring (wired now) AND a text-label slot (`setLabel`) so
  **#165 over-ship threat labels** is the second consumer (module is #165-ready, label unused this slice).
  PURE, TDD'd cores (`projectToScreen` world→screen · `shipEmphasis` foe/dim/normal · `DIM_OPACITY`); `npc.js`
  drives per-mesh material opacity off the shared predicate (0 extra draws); a `target-lock` system projects
  the foe each frame; `tw.targetLock()` QA hook. Playtest §2b3-lock asserts the foe is ring-marked + the only
  un-dimmed hull and that it clears on flee. Respects the slice-2 centre safe-zone + #146 mobile guard. Gallery
  `target-lock-161.png`. **No save change (stays v17).** 1096 unit tests. Slices 4–6 remain (#161 OPEN).
- **2026-07-01 — #161 slice 2 Non-occluding battle UI shipped (Loop 112, v0.0.20260701210637).** The marquee
  complaint of the from-owner "Make Battle FUN" epic (#161): "the popup covers my ship and I cannot see my ship
  in action." The fight prompts (`#battle`/`#cannons`/`#duel`) were dead-centre `translate(-50%,-50%)` modals
  landing on the hull the battle camera frames centre-screen. Fix: DOCK all three to a lower band with a
  `max-height:38vh` guardrail so they can never rise back into the ship zone — the UI now frames the action
  instead of blocking it. PURE, TDD'd central-safe-zone predicate (`src/ui/safe-zone.js` — `centreSafeZone` /
  `rectsOverlap` / `clearsCentre`, the single source of truth for "does this UI cover the ship?") exposed via
  `tw.battleUICentreClear()`; playtest §2b3-ui asserts every shown battle strip clears the centre on BOTH
  desktop AND a phone-portrait viewport (#146 guard) so occlusion can't regress. Felt FUN beat = you can now
  SEE your ship + the enemy the whole fight (gallery `battle-ui-161-non-occluding.png`). **No save change (stays
  v17).** 1088 unit tests. Slices 3–6 remain (#161 OPEN).
- **2026-07-01 — #161 slice 1 Hard battle isolation shipped (Loop 111, v0.0.20260701204942).** First slice of
  the from-owner "Make Battle FUN" epic (#161) — the only outright BUG: the #125 rescue offer + the open-sea
  `f`/`g` hails leaked INTO the deliberate fight (input theft + a third hull in the arena) because the helm
  stays live in the stance, so the old `!f.paused` spawn gate let a founderer heave in. Fix: a PURE, TDD'd
  isolation predicate (`src/systems/battle-isolation.js` — `interactionsSuppressed` / `ambientInteractionsAllowed`,
  the single source of truth) consulted at four seams (encounter spawn gate now DEFERS a founderer · keydown
  `f`/`g` no-op · encounter `1`/`2` choice · HUD panel dismissed while engaged). Felt FUN beat = the ABSENCE of
  the intrusion, proven by playtest §2b3-iso (real KeyboardEvents assert rescue + f/g are no-ops mid-fight, and
  the world returns on flee). **No save change (stays v17).** 1078 unit tests. Slices 2–6 remain (#161 OPEN).
- **2026-07-01 — #157 The Bosun's First Duel shipped (Loop 110, v0.0.20260701201752).** A cold save's FIRST
  engagement is a one-shot **scaffolded SOFT debut** — a forgiving, already-battered foe + the bosun calling
  each phase's verb aloud in-world (maneuver→FIRE, BOARD, surrender), fully player-driven. PURE, TDD'd logic
  (`src/systems/debut-battle.js`) + a `softenFoe` hook on battle.js. **Save v16→v17** (one-shot `debut` flag,
  migrated all prior versions + frozen v16 corpus blob, #122). 1070 unit tests + playtest §2b10 + gallery.
  Onboarding: *"my first fight is winnable and legible."*
- **2026-07-01 — FUN-FIRST encoded into the flow (owner directive).** "Prioritise fun; playable AND
  fun are both must-haves." Added FUN-FIRST as a top canonical value (`CONSTITUTION.md`); made fun the
  **first filter** of roadmap generation with GD sign-off (`PRODUCT.md`); elevated the creative spark to
  a **MUST-HAVE fun gate** + a QA "is it fun?" line (`DELIVERY.md`); signpost in `LOOP.md`. Game Designer
  owns the fun bar; working-but-not-fun is not Done. → `studio/retros/2026-07-01-fun-first.md`
- **2026-07-01 — Never-idle restructure (product + delivery split).** The loop once finished all decided
  work and **idled ~2h** waiting on the owner because the runbook was a delivery-*consumer* only, with no
  product/roadmap-generation function inside the loop. Fix: **split into two sub-runbooks** —
  `docs/runbook/PRODUCT.md` (PM + TL + Game Designer refill `queue.md` from external inspiration when it's
  empty or below a **LOW-WATER-MARK of 3** READY slices) + `docs/runbook/DELIVERY.md` (the cycle-runner
  contract, dispatch template, concurrency). Both entry runbooks (`LOOP.md`, `LOOP-SPRINT.md` + the
  `BOOTSTRAP.md` constitution) now carry **THE NEVER-IDLE RULE**: empty/thin queue → PRODUCT, never hold;
  owner decisions surface but never block. `LOOP.md` rewritten lean (orchestration + never-idle only).
- **Retro 8** (loops 37–40) — game is now *genuinely rich* (complete collision + atmosphere + named
  world + shareable Ballad #78). Relaxed retro cadence **3–4 → ~7–8** (HARD trigger 4 → 7; DL stays
  ~10). Fixed **#89**: `release.yml` → allow-list `paths:['src/**','index.html']` (no more `[skip ci]`).
  Next-direction call: #79 deception verb, then #55 art research → #32 glTF hull. → `retro-8.md`
- **Retro 7** (loops 33–36) — owner field-testing on a real iPhone. Added **`owner-channel.sh photo`**
  (fetch + VIEW owner screenshots), the **view-the-full-frame-before-fixing** rule (a zoom-in was

  (don't stack work on it). → `retro-7.md`
- **Retro 6** (loops 27–32) — depth + platform run under live owner steering (two-way channel live).

  intake routed by intent (`OWNER-CHANNEL.md` §3); `from-owner` P1 preempts. `scripts/owner-channel.sh`.
- **Retro 5** — the **Lean orchestrator protocol (post-compact)**: per-cycle = read `queue.md` top →
  dispatch one self-sufficient cycle-runner → read its <10-line report; runners own all bookkeeping;
  created `queue.md`. → `retro-5.md`
